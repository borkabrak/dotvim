VIM

This is a portable version of my vim setup

After an initial checkout, you'll probably have to update the plugins (which
have their own git repos by doing a :BundleInstall! )

BRANCHES

master

Of course

doc

This is for NON-FUNCTIONAL documentation, comments, and formatting
changes.  Very important stuff, but nice to keep separate from things that
affect how the code actually behaves.
